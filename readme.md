# haiku-helper-site

This is a standalone website, running on koa static.

It's extremely simple, has one page only, can count vowels and mark
moras in each and every line in an editable field,
which useful for analyzing or reproducing antique poetry.

## Example

```
Gyűlölöm azt, aki telt kupa mellett bort iszogatván |
  - U U  -    U U  -   U  U  -  -    -   U  U -  -  | 16
háborut emleget és lélekölő viadalt.                |
 - U U  -  U U  -   - U U -  UU -                   | 14
```

## Usage

The fastest way to fire it up locally is `npm i && npm run dev`:
listens on port 8080 at localhost.

## TODO

Publish to github as a static site. Will do sometime :)
